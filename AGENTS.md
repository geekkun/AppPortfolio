# Shared Conventions

## Git

- Commit messages: `type: short description` (feat, fix, refactor, docs, ci, chore)
- Branch naming: `type/short-description` or `phase-N-description`
- Squash merge to the default branch and keep GitHub's commit list in the message (the version's PATCH counts it). A repo that already uses merge commits keeps them.
- **Push after EVERY commit. No exceptions.** Sessions can be interrupted — unpushed work is permanently lost.
- **Commit after each meaningful unit of work**, not after all tasks are done. Never accumulate more than ~30 minutes of uncommitted work.
- A "meaningful unit" = one logical change that doesn't break the build. Exception: files that must change together go in one commit.
- **Merge your own PRs** once review findings are fixed and CI is green. If a merge deploys, take the backup the project's CLAUDE.md asks for first. Stop and hand over only when a PR needs something only the owner can do (a BotFather setting, a secret, a payment), or when the project's CLAUDE.md says otherwise.
- **Merge-as-you-go: one PR at a time.** Branch each phase from up-to-date `main`; when it's done and CI is green, merge it, then branch the next phase from the updated default branch. **Never stack PRs** — don't branch a phase off an unmerged phase branch (it chains the PRs, pollutes each diff with the previous phase, and forces rebase cascades). If work must continue before a merge, keep it on one evolving branch/PR, not a stack.
- **NEVER force-push** or amend published commits unless explicitly asked.
- **No destructive git.** Never run commands that discard uncommitted changes (`reset`, `checkout .`, `clean`, `restore .`, `stash drop/clear`, etc.). Add on top of staged files — don't nuke the index. When in doubt, ask.
- **Ask before destroying what you didn't create:** `rm -rf` outside your own scratch or build files, killing processes you didn't start, dropping databases, anything on a production box beyond the project's documented deploy steps. Approval for one such action doesn't cover the next.
- **Commit instead of stashing.** Never stash to rebase: commit WIP, fetch, rebase, continue. At most one stash ever.

## Working Style

### Shortest Path First
- **ALWAYS lead with the quickest, simplest option.** Present the one-liner first. Put the longer alternative after, labeled "alternatively".
- When giving commands, consolidate into as few copy-paste blocks as possible.

### Planning First
- Plan complex work before writing code: a spec, then a plan, both committed. When something goes sideways, stop and re-plan instead of pushing a broken approach.

### Use Subagents
- Use subagents for parallel independent work (searching, reading files, implement + review).
- **At most 2–4 agents at once.** One implementer and one reviewer is the default pairing. Never run two agents that edit the same file. The owner watches a token budget, and a fan-out of a dozen agents is a failure even when the code is right.

### After Every Correction
- When the user corrects a mistake, update the relevant CLAUDE.md so it doesn't recur.

### Persist Intermediate Work
- **Specs and plans** → `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`, `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`, committed (where the superpowers skills write them)
- **Ephemeral agent thinking** (reviews, brainstorming, session state) → `tmp/` (gitignored)
- Context compression destroys conversation history; persisted files survive.
- Big ideas and improvements that won't be done now → create GitHub issues so they're not forgotten.

### Splitting work across sessions (pattern: guest-bot)
- Three kinds of session, glued by GitHub Issues: the **local CLI session** (the only one with box access — data, merges, coordination), a **desktop visual-QA session** (Chrome + iOS Simulator, never touches code; files one issue per problem with the repo's issue forms), and **cloud sessions** that each take ONE issue labelled `ready` and not `in-progress`, comment «taking this», add `in-progress`, and ship a PR that says `Closes #N`.
- `ready` = specified enough to pick up, added by the organizer or the main session, never by QA. Keep the two briefs in the repo (`docs/cloud-sessions.md`, `docs/qa/README.md`) so a fresh session needs no chat history.

### Multi-Persona Reviews
- For major changes, run multiple agent perspectives (code reviewer, SRE, end-user, product) to find blind spots.
- Save each persona's output to `tmp/` or `docs/reviews/`, then synthesize into actionable items.

## Versioning

**The version is computed from git, never typed in. No agent bumps anything, so parallel PRs never conflict over it.**
- **MINOR = PRs merged on the default branch**, **PATCH = that PR's commits** (a direct push to the default branch adds one). On an unmerged branch: the default branch's MINOR at the merge-base + 1. MAJOR = a deliberate edit of the script's anchor.
- The project ships `scripts/version.sh [<rev>]` (POSIX sh, git only) that prints it. Pattern: guest-bot `scripts/version.sh` + `tests/test_version_script.py`; set its main-branch name, anchor commit and anchor MINOR when copying.
- **The deploy writes it** to a file on the data volume (e.g. `data/VERSION`; images carry no `.git`), and the app reads that file once at startup — `0.0.0` when missing. No version line in the code, no pre-commit hook.
- CI checks out full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) and fails if the script can't print a version. Squash merges keep GitHub's default commit list in the message (that's where PATCH comes from).
- **This overrides any "bump PATCH/MINOR by hand" or pre-commit-hook rule** left in a project's CLAUDE.md or sub-CLAUDE.md files. Delete such a rule when you see one.
- **A project still on a hand-written `VERSION`:** migrating is its own PR (anchor = the default-branch tip it branches from, anchor MINOR = the current MINOR). Until that PR merges, don't bump in a feature PR at all — leave the line alone and let the migration replace it. If an old bump hook is installed, commit with `--no-verify` or remove it from `.git/hooks`.

## Changelog

No changelog section in `CLAUDE.md`. **Each PR adds one file `docs/changes/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`** — what changed, why, the names a later session will grep for, the tests that pin it — with **no version number** (git knows it only at merge; the PR number and date place it). New files never conflict. `CLAUDE.md` holds what is true now (rules, gotchas), not history; a new rule goes there too. Pattern: guest-bot `docs/changes/README.md`.

## Code Review

- **One issue = one GH comment.** Never group multiple issues into one comment.
- **Post every finding you verified.** Post an unverified one too, labelled as unverified, instead of dropping it. Don't pad a review with style nits the linter already covers.

## Code Quality

- Meaningful variable names, no unnecessary abbreviations
- Type hints / type annotations everywhere applicable
- Docstrings / JSDoc for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer explicit over implicit

## Security

- Secrets in `.env` file, gitignored. Never commit tokens or keys.
- Bot tokens, API keys, SECRET_KEY — environment variables only.
- Input validation at all boundaries.

## Docker

- Build from the official slim images (`python:3.13-slim` / `python:3.14-slim`), multi-stage for production. Every current project does this. The meta-repo's `docker/*-base` images exist but nothing uses them.
- Everything runs in Docker: tests, lockfile regeneration, one-off scripts.

## CI/CD

- GitHub Actions for all projects
- Shared workflow templates in `shared/.github/workflows/`
- **CI (PR):** lint with ruff → Docker build (Buildx + GHA cache) → import verify → tests
- **Deploy (push to main):** build + test → SSH to VPS → `git pull && docker compose up -d --build` → health check
- `paths-ignore`: `**/*.md`, `docs/**`, `.claude/**`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (and `tests/**` on deploy). A bare `*.md` matches only the repo root, so a docs-only PR touching a package's `CLAUDE.md` still deploys.
- Required GitHub Secrets for deploy: `VPS_SSH_KEY`, `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_PORT`, `DEPLOY_PATH`
- Django projects: add migration check (`makemigrations --check --dry-run`) to CI
- Next.js projects: artifact-based deploy with PM2 process manager

# Swift

## Runtime
- Swift 6+, strict concurrency checking

## Style & Tooling
- Swift Package Manager for dependencies
- Prefer `struct` over `class` unless reference semantics needed
- Use `async/await` over completion handlers
- Leverage the type system — avoid `Any` and force unwrapping
- Naming: camelCase for types and properties (e.g., `bankModel`, `cardModel`)
- Logger: `OSLog` with app bundle ID as subsystem

## Architecture
- MVVM or similar separation
- Protocol-oriented design where appropriate
- Use `@Observable` macro (iOS 17+)
- WidgetKit for home screen widgets (small/medium/large)
- UserNotifications for reminders

## Localization
- Russian primary, English in progress
- Use `Localizable.xcstrings` for all user-facing strings
